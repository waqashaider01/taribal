                        <p>As a general contractor, Tribal-xtc plays a vital role in ensuring a construction project is properly planned, managed and executed. We work diligently to define the project scope and budget; identify potential construction or zoning challenges; and determine priorities. We involve our subcontractors early in the process to gather their input and ensure state of the market pricing and accurate schedules are set. Throughout the project, we continually focus on collaboration, bringing together the input and expertise of the owner, architect, subcontractors and engineers. Our strong management and meticulous eye for detail help ensure that each project is completed on time and on budget.</p>

                        <p>A construction management option, which consents tribal-xtc to manage your project from concept to completion, is typically provided for our clients who require a Cost/Plus solution to their construction needs. This transparent, open book solution allows us to be involved and to participate in the early stages of the design development. This option also results in accurately determining progressive costs, value engineering, and allowing tribal-xt to better manage the construction budget throughout the entire design and construction process.</p> 
                        <p>The design-build concept is a very attractive solution for many of our current clients. This option harmonies the traditional Architect/Engineer–General Contractor process to be streamlined to a single point of contact.  Such a turnkey approach allows design and construction to overlap resulting in significant time savings. In addition, we involve our subcontracting partners in the design process to ensure state of the market pricing and accurate schedule expectations.</p>
<p>Tribal-xtc advocates and practices environmentally responsible building techniques. The employees at Tribal-xtc work diligently with building owners, architects and engineers in the practices of increasing building efficiency using energy, water and material resources, while reducing a building's impact on human health and the environment. 
Tribal-xtc has had extensive experience working closely with the Merchandise Mart, among other clients, in its endeavors to become a completely GREEN building.</p>
<p>Proper planning is the key to managing construction cost and scheduling issues. We work with clients early in the process to ensure that priorities and job details are defined; costs and construction considerations are understood; and all parties are on the same track toward completion.</p>
  <p>Our estimators and project managers work attentively with owners, architects and tenants to identify the expectations of all parties and to establish a tailored program in order to achieve the final goal. We provide current market cost estimation, realistic scheduling and detailed value engineering as part of all pre-construction assignments.</p>
<p>From our early days as a self-performing general contractor, Tribal-xtc has maintained a workforce of experienced and highly skilled professionals. The availability of this workforce has allowed us to react quickly to our clients’ needs. We currently employ in excess of supervisors, carpenters, laborers and painters.  we have capabilities to self-perform demolition, drywall and framing, carpentry and Painting.</p>
